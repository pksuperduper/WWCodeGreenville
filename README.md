<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

There are a ton of great repos out there to contribute to, but this one was made for the members of WWCodeGreenville to help build and develop their skills along with building the community.

But why?
* WomenWhoCode's mission is to help women succeed in technology careers, and what better way to do that than to actively contribute!
* Your time should be focused on creating something amazing. This repo is made to help accomplish that with clearly defined issues for all skill levels.

If there are any questions, please let us know. :smile:

<!-- PREREQUISITES -->
### Prerequisites
- Installing a free code editor, such as VS Code, before starting is highly recommended.
- A GitHub account is required to contribute to our repository.
- Learning about basic git commands is helpful, but not required.  See the Installation section for options with or without using git commands.
- Updating this repository's documentation will require learning Markdown.  This [free guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) can help.

<!-- INSTALLATION -->
### Installation
There are two ways to use git to interact with our repository: command-line git or through a desktop git app.
1. git Command Line: There are many free tutorials that can walk you through the commands.  [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/git-and-github-for-beginners/) has a great beginner tutorial.
2. Desktop Git App: Another way that users can interact with our repository is through a desktop app like Github's own [Desktop App](https://desktop.github.com/), which has simple UI and can be intuitive for first time users.

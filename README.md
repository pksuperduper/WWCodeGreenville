<h2 id='installation' class='wwc-yellow-heading'>Installation</h2>

There are two ways to use git to interact with our repository: command-line Git or through a desktop Git app.
1. Git Command Line: There are many free tutorials that can walk you through the commands.  [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/git-and-github-for-beginners/) has a great beginner tutorial.
2. Desktop Git App: Another way that users can interact with our repository is through a desktop app like Github's own [Desktop App](https://desktop.github.com/), which has simple UI and can be intuitive for first time users.
